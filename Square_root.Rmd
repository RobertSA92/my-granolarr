```

# Pipe example

This is my first [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) document.


```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

The code uses the pipe operator:

- takes 2 as input
- calculates the square root
- rounds the value
    - keeping only two digits
    

```{r, echo=TRUE}
2 %>%
  sqrt() %>%
  round(digits = 2)
```
