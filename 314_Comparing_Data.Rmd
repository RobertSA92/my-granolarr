# Question 314.1.1: 

Load the 2011_OAC_Raw_uVariables_Leicester.csv dataset. Check whether the values of mean age (u020) are normally distributed, and whether they can be transformed to a normally distributed set using logarithmic or inverse hyperbolic sine functions. 


### Load packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(knitr)
```

### Load data

```{r}

leicester_2011OAC <-
read.csv("2011_OAC_raw_uVariables_Leicester.csv")
```


### Data preperation

### Explore distribution

```{r}

leicester_2011OAC %$% u020 %>%
stats::shapiro.test()
```


```{r}

leicester_2011OAC %>%
ggplot2::ggplot(
aes(
x = u011
)
) +
ggplot2::geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) +
ggplot2::theme_bw()

```



The values of mean age are not normally distributed.


### logarithmic transformation 

```{r}

logu020 <- leicester_2011OAC %>%
  mutate(log10_u020 = log10(u020))

logu020 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log10_u020)) +
  ggplot2::geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
  ggplot2::theme_grey()


```
```{r}
logu020 %$% log10_u020 %>% stats::shapiro.test()

```


Mean age can successfully transformed into a normal distribution with a logarithmic transformation.


# Question 314.1.2:

Check whether the values of mean age (u020) are normally distributed when looking at the different 2011OAC supergroups separately. Check whether they can be transformed to a normally distributed set using logarithmic or inverse hyperbolic sine functions.


```{r}
  
leicester_2011OAC %>% dplyr::filter(supgrpname == "Suburbanites") %>% 
  dplyr::pull(u020) %>% stats::shapiro.test()
```
Suburbanites data is normally distributed. 

```{r}
leicester_2011OAC %>% dplyr::filter(supgrpname == "Cosmopolitans") %>%
  dplyr::pull(u020) %>% stats::shapiro.test()
```
Cosmopolitans data is not normally distributed. 
```{r}
leicester_2011OAC %>% dplyr::filter(supgrpname == "Multicultural Metropolitans") %>% 
  dplyr::pull(u020) %>% stats::shapiro.test()
```
Multicultural Metropolitans data is not normally distributed. 
```{r}
leicester_2011OAC %>% dplyr::filter(supgrpname == "Ethnicity Central") %>% 
  dplyr::pull(u020) %>% stats::shapiro.test()
```
Ethnicity Central data is not normally distributed. 
```{r}
leicester_2011OAC %>% dplyr::filter(supgrpname == "Constrained City Dwellers") %>% 
  dplyr::pull(u020) %>% stats::shapiro.test()
```
Constrained City Dwellers data is not normally distributed. 
```{r}
leicester_2011OAC %>% dplyr::filter(supgrpname == "Hard-Pressed Living") %>% 
  dplyr::pull(u020) %>% stats::shapiro.test()
```
Hard-Pressed Living data is not normally distributed. 
```{r}
leicester_2011OAC %>% dplyr::filter(supgrpname == "Urbanites") %>% 
  dplyr::pull(u020) %>% stats::shapiro.test()

```
Urbanites data is not normally distributed. 



## Logarithmic Transormation

### Hard-Pressed Living with Logarithmic Transformation.

```{r}

leicester_2011OAC %>%
  dplyr::filter(supgrpname == "Hard-Pressed Living") %>%
  mutate(log10_u020 = log10(u020)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log10_u020)) +
  ggplot2::geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
  ggplot2::theme_grey()

```
```{r}

leicester_2011OAC %>%
  dplyr::filter(supgrpname == "Hard-Pressed Living") %>%
  mutate(log10_u020 = log10(u020)) %$%
  log10_u020 %>%
  stats::shapiro.test()
```
Hard-pressed living data remains not normally distributed after logarithmic transformation as it falls above the a significance threshold of p < 0.01.



### Constrained City Dwellers with Logarithmic Transformation. 

```{r}

logccd <- leicester_2011OAC %>%
  dplyr::filter(supgrpname == "Constrained City Dwellers") %>%
  mutate(log10_u020 = log10(u020))

logccd %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log10_u020)) +
  ggplot2::geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
  ggplot2::theme_grey()
```
````{r}

leicester_2011OAC %>%
  dplyr::filter(supgrpname == "Constrained City Dwellers") %>%
  mutate(log10_u020 = log10(u020)) %$%
  log10_u020 %>%
  stats::shapiro.test()
```

Constrained City Dwellers data remains not normally distributed after logarithmic transformation as it falls above the a significance threshold of p < 0.01.







# Question 314.1.3: 

Is the distribution of mean age (u020) different in different2011OAC supergroups in Leicester?


```{r}

loglei <- leicester_2011OAC %>%
  mutate(log10_u020 = log10(u020))


loglei %$%
stats::aov(log10_u020 ~ supgrpname) %>%
summary ()
```


The difference is significant F(6, 962) = 43.86, p < .01.







# Question 314.2.1: 

As mentioned above, when discussing movement in cities, there is an assumption that people living in the city centre live in flats and work or cycle to work, whereas people living in the suburbs live in whole houses and commute via car. Study the correlation between the presence of flats (u089) and people commuting to work on foot, bicycle or other similar means (u122) in the same OAs. Consider whether the values might need to be normalised or otherwised transformed before starting the testing procedure.



## Normalise data

```{r}
flats_and_commutefbo <-
leicester_2011OAC %>%
dplyr::mutate(
perc_flats = (u089 / Total_Household_Spaces) * 100,
perc_commutefbo = (u122 / Total_Household_Spaces) * 100
) %>%
dplyr::select(
OA11CD, supgrpname, supgrpcode,
perc_flats, perc_commutefbo
)

```


## Evaluate distribution

### Presence of flats (u089)

```{r}

flats_and_commutefbo %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(mapping = aes(x = perc_flats)) +
  ggplot2::geom_histogram(bins = 30) + 
  ggplot2::theme_gray()

```

```{r}
flats_and_commutefbo %$% perc_flats %>% stats::shapiro.test()
```
Presence of flats data is not normally distributed. 



### People communting by foot, bicylce or other similar means (u122)

```{r}

flats_and_commutefbo %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(mapping = aes(x = perc_commutefbo)) +
  ggplot2::geom_histogram(bins = 30) + 
  ggplot2::theme_gray()

```
```{r}
flats_and_commutefbo %$% perc_commutefbo %>% stats::shapiro.test()
```
People communting by foot, bicylce or other similar means data is not normally distributed. 


## Consider inverse hyperbolic sine transformation

```{r}
flats_and_commutefbo %>%
dplyr::select(perc_flats, perc_commutefbo) %>%
dplyr::mutate(
ihs_perc_flats = asinh(perc_flats),
ihs_perc_commutefbo = asinh(perc_commutefbo)
) %>%
pastecs::stat.desc(basic = FALSE, desc = FALSE, norm = TRUE) %>%
knitr::kable()

```

Pearson's r cannot be used as the data for each variable remains not normally distributed even with inverse hyperbolic sine applied. 


## Check for ties

```{r}
ties_perc_flats <-
flats_and_commutefbo %>%
dplyr::count(perc_flats) %>%
dplyr::filter(n > 1) %>%
# Specify wt = n() to count rows
# otherwise n is taken as weight
dplyr::count(n()) %>%
dplyr::pull(n)

ties_perc_flats
```
The presence of flats contains `r ties_perc_flats` ties. 

```{r}
ties_perc_commutefbo <-
flats_and_commutefbo %>%
dplyr::count(perc_commutefbo) %>%
dplyr::filter(n > 1) %>%
# Specify wt = n() to count rows
# otherwise n is taken as weight
dplyr::count(n()) %>%
dplyr::pull(n)

ties_perc_commutefbo
```


People commuting by foot, bicycle or other similar means has `r ties_perc_commutefbo` ties. 

As there are many ties within the data a Spearman's rank correlation cannot be used. 


## Kendall's rank correlation tau

```{r}
flats_and_commutefbo_corKendall <-
flats_and_commutefbo %$%
stats::cor.test(
perc_flats, perc_commutefbo,
method = "kendall"
)
flats_and_commutefbo_corKendall
```

The percentage of flats and the percentage of people that commute by foot, bicycle or other similar means, per OA, in the city of Leicester, are negative related, as the relationship is significant (‘p-value < 0.01‘) and the correlation value is negative (‘tau =‘ -0.20). The two variables share 4.0% of variance. We can thus conclude that there is significant but very weak relationship between the two variables.  




# Question 314.2.2: 

Another interesting issue to explore is the relationship between car ownership and the use of public transport. Study the correlation between the presence of households owning 2 or more cars or vans (u118) and people commuting to work via public transport (u120) or on foot, bicycle or other similar means (u122) in the same OAs. Consider whether the values might need to be normalised or otherwised transformed before starting the testing procedure.


## Normalise data

```{r}
cars_and_commute <-
leicester_2011OAC %>%
dplyr::mutate(
perc_twoormore_cars = (u118 / Total_Households) * 100,
perc_commutefbo = ((u122 + u120) / Total_Pop_No_NI_Students_16_to_74) * 100) %>%
dplyr::select(
OA11CD, supgrpname, supgrpcode, perc_twoormore_cars, perc_commutefbo
)

```



## Explore distribution.

### Households owning 2 or more cars or vans (u118).

```{r}

cars_and_commute %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = perc_twoormore_cars)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) + 
  theme_gray()
```
```{r}
cars_and_commute %$% perc_twoormore_cars %>% stats::shapiro.test()
```



```{r}
cars_and_commute %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = perc_commutefbo)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) + 
  theme_gray()
```


```{r}
cars_and_commute %$% perc_commutefbo %>% stats::shapiro.test()
```



## Consider inverse hyperbolic sine transformations

```{r}
ihs_cars_and_commute <- cars_and_commute %>%
dplyr::select(perc_twoormore_cars, perc_commutefbo) %>%
dplyr::mutate(
ihs_perc_cars = asinh(perc_twoormore_cars),
ihs_perc_commutefbo = asinh(perc_commutefbo)
) %>%
pastecs::stat.desc(basic = FALSE, desc = FALSE, norm = TRUE) %>%
knitr::kable()

ihs_cars_and_commute
```


Pearson's r cannot be used as the data for each variable remains not normally distributed even with inverse hyperbolic sine applied. 

## Check for ties

```{r}
ties_perc_twoormore_cars <-
cars_and_commute %>%
dplyr::count(perc_twoormore_cars) %>%
dplyr::filter(n > 1) %>%
# Specify wt = n() to count rows
# otherwise n is taken as weight
dplyr::count(n()) %>%
dplyr::pull(n)

ties_perc_twoormore_cars
```
The variable for households with 2 or more cars or vans has `r ties_perc_twoormore_cars` ties.

```{r}
ties_perc_commutefbo <-
cars_and_commute %>%
dplyr::count(perc_commutefbo) %>%
dplyr::filter(n > 1) %>%
# Specify wt = n() to count rows
# otherwise n is taken as weight
dplyr::count(n()) %>%
dplyr::pull(n)

ties_perc_commutefbo
```

THe variable for people commuting on foot, bicycle or other similar means has `r ties_perc_commutefbo` ties. 


As there are many ties within the data, a Spearman's rank correlation cannot be used. 


## Kendall's Rank Correlation Tau 

```{r}
cars_and_commutefbo_corKendall <-
cars_and_commute %$%
stats::cor.test(
perc_twoormore_cars, perc_commutefbo,
method = "kendall"
)
cars_and_commutefbo_corKendall
```
The percentage of households owning 2 or more cars or vans and the percentage of people who commute by foot, bicycle or other similar means are negative related, as the relationship is significant (‘p-value < 0.01‘) and the correlation value is negative
(‘tau =‘ -0.19). The two variables share 3.6% of variance. We can thus conclude that there is significant but extremely weak relationship between the two variables.
